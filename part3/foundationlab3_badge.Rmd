The final activity for each learning lab provides space to work with data and to reflect on how the concepts and techniques introduced in each lab might apply to your own research.

To earn a badge for each lab, you are required to respond to a set of prompts for two parts: 

-   In Part I, you will reflect on your understanding of key concepts and begin to think about potential next steps for your own study.

-   In Part II, you will create a simple data product in R that demonstrates your ability to apply a data analysis technique introduced in this learning lab.

### Part I: Reflect and Plan

Use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a research article, presentation, or resource that applies learning analytics analysis to an educational context or topic of interest. More specifically, **locate a study that makes use of one of the data structures we learned today.** You are also welcome to select one of your research papers.

1.  Provide an APA citation for your selected study.

    -   

2.  What educational issue, “problem of practice,” and/or questions were addressed?

    -   

3.  What are some common approaches EDA approaches used and what did they entail?


    -   

4.  How were data visualization or feature engineering used to support analysis, if at all?What were the key findings or conclusions?

    -   
    
5. Finally,  what value, if any, might education practitioners find in these results?

    -   

Draft a new research question of guided by the the phases of the Learning Anlytics Workflow. Or use one of your current research questions.

1.  What educational issue, “problem of practice,” and/or questions is  addressed??

    -   

2.  Briefly describe any steps of the EDA approach that will be used.

    -
 


3.  What elements of EDA might require human judgement and decision making?

    -
