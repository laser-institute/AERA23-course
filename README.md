Introduction to the concepts of open science and reproducible research for application to learning analytics using R and R Studio.

**TOPICS**
- **Reproducible Research**
This presentation provides a conceptual overview of reproducible research, particularly as it pertains to open science, and describe the core practices of reproducible research.

- **GitHub Desktop**
We briefly introduce the concept of version control as a one core practice of reproducible research. The presentation will cover adding version control to the learning analytics workflow using [github.com](https://github.com/) and an application called Github Desktop. We will become familiar with navigating github.com and examining the file structures associated with repositories. 

- **RStudio Desktop**
We introduce the RStudio Desktop environment and getting started with R. We will become familiar with the R Environment, setting up global options, creating R scripts and the basic grammar of the R programming language.

The accompanying code-along introduces basic programming concepts in R, such as using functions, proving arguments to functions, creating objects, and installing packages. Finally, we will learn how to knit RMarkdown files to produce readable, shareable versions of our work.
