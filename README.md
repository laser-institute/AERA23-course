# AERA Short Course

## Part One - R Studio Introduction
Introduction to the concepts of open science and reproducible research for application to learning analytics using R and R Studio.

**TOPICS**

- **Reproducible Research**
This presentation provides a conceptual overview of reproducible research, particularly as it pertains to open science, and describe the core practices of reproducible research.

- **GitHub Desktop**
We briefly introduce the concept of version control as a one core practice of reproducible research. The presentation will cover adding version control to the learning analytics workflow using [github.com](https://github.com/) and an application called Github Desktop. We will become familiar with navigating github.com and examining the file structures associated with repositories. 

- **RStudio Desktop**
We introduce the RStudio Desktop environment and getting started with R. We will become familiar with the R Environment, setting up global options, creating R scripts and the basic grammar of the R programming language.

The accompanying code-along introduces basic programming concepts in R, such as using functions, proving arguments to functions, creating objects, and installing packages. Finally, we will learn how to knit RMarkdown files to produce readable, shareable versions of our work.

## Part Two - Foundations of Learning Analytics - focus on "EXPLORE phase"

**TOPICS**

- **Learning Analytics**
As a powerful approach to STEM education research that can offer deep, sustained, and systematic interrogation in societal decision making. For example, researchers and practitioners use LA to improve learning and teaching in K-12 with real-time Dashboards, in Higher Education Multimodal Learning Analytics study collaboration and self-regulation, Text Mining gives insight with sentiment analysis on educational reform, and Social Network analysis can help us to understand costudying relationships.

- **Learning Analytics (LA) Workflow**
Krumm et al. (2018) postulates "a workflow is a set of processes that transform inputs into outputs across multiple steps and decisions." The LA workflow is intended to support *researchers, practitioners, and data scientists* prepare for a data-intensive analysis and communicate oneâ€™s findings through *Prepare, Wrangle, Explore, Model and Communicate*.

- **Data Visualizations as a means of story telling**
What is visualization in the educational setting? How do visualizations bring attention to issues that must be addressed?

- **GGPLOT GRAMMAR and Graphs**
