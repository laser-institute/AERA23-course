# AERA Short Course

## ðŸ”‰ **Welcome and LASER**
Introduction to the LASER TEAM and We will share resources, groups and other ways to connect with the Learning Analytics community.


## ðŸ”‰ **Foundations of Learning Analytics**

### PART ONE:
- **Learning Analytics (LA) Workflow**
Krumm et al. (2018) postulate that "a workflow is a set of processes that transform inputs into outputs across multiple steps and decisions." The LA workflow supports *researchers, practitioners, and data scientists* preparing for data-intensive analysis and communicating one's findings through *Prepare, Wrangle, Explore, Model, and Communicate*. The accompanying code-along focuses on introducing the basic grammar of R functions, objects and packages.


### PART TWO:
- **Data Products as a means to do Learning Analytics.** This presentation is a review of the types of data typically used to perform learning analytics in education. The focus of the essential readings are to introduce LASER Scholars to the most common data structures used in Learning Analytics. We will look closely at Digital Learning Environments, Administrative Data and Sensors / Multimodal. The accompanying code-along focuses on the **WRANGLE** phase of LA.



### PART THREE:
- **Data Visualizations as a means of storytelling with GGPLOT GRAMMAR and Graphs**
What is visualization in the educational setting? How do visualizations bring attention to issues that must be addressed? 
The overview introduces and reviews some of the basic principles of data visualization as it relates to data graphics, including data visualization perception and color through storytelling.
- Using a hands-on, minds-on approach, we dive into the ggplot2 grammar in a simple-to-understand layering method. We will create static representations of numeric variables for some of the most popular geoms; histogram and scatter plots. Once we are comfortable with ggplot, we will introduce interactive visualization following a similar ggplot grammar. Grounded by a specific educational research question, the accompanying code-along focuses on the **EXPLORE, MODEL and COMMUNICATE** phase of LA.




## ðŸ”‰ **Finish up and Share Out**
Having an opportunity to reflect and share out on how you may use some of these new concepts in your work. What are some other areas that you are interested in as it relates to Learning Analytics and its branches?

- **Wrap-UP**
What now?
