# AERA Short Course

## ðŸ”‰ Part One - Welcome and R Studio
Introduction to the concepts of open science and reproducible research for application to learning analytics using R and R Studio.

But, first...

ðŸ§Š**ICEBREAKER**ðŸ§Š
Yup, yet another icebreaker...but... we will try to make it painless and not awkward. Let's get a little comfortable with the group and less stressed about starting a new programming language.


**TOPICS**

- **Reproducible Research**
This presentation provides a conceptual overview of reproducible research, particularly as it pertains to open science, and describes the core practices of reproducible research.

- **GitHub Desktop**
We briefly introduce the concept of version control as one core practice of reproducible research. The presentation will cover adding version control to the learning analytics workflow using [github.com](https://github.com/) and an application called Github Desktop. We will view the navigation of github.com and examining the file structures associated with repositories. However we are not using Github Desktop for our course due to time constraints.

- **RStudio Desktop**
We introduce the RStudio Desktop environment and how to get started with R. We will become familiar with the R environment, setting up global options, creating R scripts, and the basic grammar of the R programming language.

The accompanying code-along introduces basic programming concepts in R, such as using functions, proving arguments to functions, creating objects, and installing packages. Finally, we will learn how to knit RMarkdown files to produce readable, shareable versions of our work.


## ðŸ”‰ Part Two - Foundations of Learning Analytics -
### focus on the "EXPLORE phase."


**TOPICS**

- **Learning Analytics**
As a powerful approach to STEM education research LA can offer profound, sustained, and systematic interrogation in societal decision-making. For example, researchers and practitioners use LA to improve learning and teaching in K-12 with real-time Dashboards, in Higher Education, Multimodal Learning Analytics are used to study collaboration and self-regulation. Text Mining gives insight with sentiment analysis on educational reform, and Social Network analysis is helping us to understand costudying relationships.

- **Learning Analytics (LA) Workflow**
Krumm et al. (2018) postulate that "a workflow is a set of processes that transform inputs into outputs across multiple steps and decisions." The LA workflow supports *researchers, practitioners, and data scientists* preparing for data-intensive analysis and communicating one's findings through *Prepare, Wrangle, Explore, Model, and Communicate*.

- **Data Visualizations as a means of storytelling**
What is visualization in the educational setting? How do visualizations bring attention to issues that must be addressed? 

- **GGPLOT GRAMMAR and Graphs**
The overview introduces and reviews some of the basic principles of data visualization as it relates to data graphics, including data visualization perception and color through storytelling.

 Using a hands-on, minds-on approach, we dive into the ggplot2 grammar in a simple-to-understand layering method. We will create static representations of numeric variables for some of the most popular geoms; histogram and scatter plots. Once we are comfortable with ggplot, we will introduce interactive visualization following a similar ggplot grammar. Grounded by a specific educational research question, the accompanying code-along focuses on the **EXPLORE** phase of LA.


## ðŸ”‰ Part Three: Text Mining
The transition to digital learning has made available new data sources, providing researchers new opportunities for understanding and improving STEM learning. Data sources such as digital learning environments and administrative data systems, as well as data produced by social media websites and the mass digitization of academic and practitioner publications, hold enormous potential to address a range of pressing problems in STEM Education, but collecting and analyzing text-based data also presents unique challenges.


**TOPICS**
Guided by our Text mining Case Study: Do the public like NGSS? We will investigate the public sentiment expressed toward the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and compare the sentiment for NGSS and Common Core State Standards using Twitter data. This study is from [Dr. Joshua Rosenberg's team](https://osf.io/xymsd/).

- **Text Mining Basics - Tidy Text & Word Counts**
Following a gentle introduction to getting our text "tidy" so we can perform some basic word counts, look at words that occur at a higher rate in a group of documents, examine words that are unique to those document groups, and create visualizations such as word cloud.

- **Dictionary-Methods - Twitter Sentiment and School Reform**
Moving beyond basic concepts of text mining and taking a closer look at a dictionary-based text mining technique, sentiment analysis. This technique is beneficial for us to understand people's opinions about things such as a policy.

The accompanying code-along introduces the concepts and techniques from the Text Mining Basics and Dictionary Methods topics. Sprinkling many opportunities for open discussion and reflection on how these concepts and techniques might apply to your research.


## ðŸ”‰ Part Four: Share out and Wrap up


**TOPICS**

- **Share Out**
Having an opportunity to reflect and share out on how you may use some of these new concepts in your work. What are some other areas that you are interested in as it relates to Learning Analytics and its branches?

- **Wrap-UP**
What now? Will will share resources, groups and other ways to connect with the Learnign Analytics community.
