In the following presentation we will discuss a conceptual overview of reproducible research. we'll discuss what open science and more specifically what reproducible research is, describe core practices of reproducible research.  

Additionally, we will briefly go over R syntax. But more on that when we get into the nitty gritty of coding with ggplot.

Okay, be honest. Have you ever gotten lost or confused during your own research process because
your files got disorganized or your naming structure broke down? Let's fix that...

---
# Putting Reproducibility into Practice

- How do you manage your data in research?
- How do you document who did what and when?
- When the results of your analyses change, do you know why?


???

How reproducible is my work?

If you were to ask a colleague to take one of your papers and reproduce your results, could 
they do it? Could you do it for one of theirs?


Take just a moment and think about how you put reproducibility into practice in your own research. 
What does this look like for your research data management? How do you document who 
did what and when? If your results change, can you say why they changed?

Managing these types issues is how we put reproducibility into practice and one way to do that is with version control.

# What is version control?

**Version control** is keeping a .orange[**history of a file's changes**].

Chances are that you're already familiar with the concept of version control. If you've ever looked at the revision history of a Google doc, for example, then you have seen version control. 

Version control gives a history of the versions of a file, who made the changes in that version, how many changes, and what those changes actually were in that version.

???
**What is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE)?**

So this is an image of the R studio integrated development environment. You can see that there are these four main panels and if you're not seeing all four of those panels it's probably because something has been minimized and we can show you how to fix that here in person.

The IDE four main areas
- Console (&amp; Terminal)
- Scripting and Viewing Window
- Files/Plots/Packages/Help
- Environment (&amp; Connections/Git)

**CONSOLE:**
The console will show you what items have been run and any errors
The terminal provides access to the system shell. By default it is in the bottom left of your screen and you can view your script output here depending how you set up your global options.

***Scripting and Viewing:**
The Script Window is the place to enter and run your code so that it is easily edited and saved for future use.
Two ways to execute your code in the R script, you can either highlight the code and click on Run, or you can highlight the code and press CTRL + Enter on your keyboard.

**Environment Window:**
The Environment tab allows you to see what objects are in the work space.
The history tab allows you to see the commands that you have entered.
The git tab from your project allows you to connect and update right to Github.

**Files pane**
Access all of your files for a projects
- view your plots (data visualizations)
- view what packages are installed
- the help tab will show you more information about a function or package similar to adding a question mark before a package name or function name.
- view your Rmarkdown file 

We can use 
**Global options:** to customize the IDE to better suite your workflow with things like...
- wrap code
- change color scheme
- move panes around
- so much more

Let's set up our Global Options for a smooth workflow
- In the menu bar click `Tools` then `Global Options.`
    + 1. `R General` -&gt; (untick) Restore .RData into workspace at startup.
    + 2. `R General` -&gt; Save workspace to .RData on exit: Never
    + 3. `R Markdown` -&gt; Show output preview in: Viewer Pane


Today we will be working in a script file. A script is simply a text file containing a set of commands and comments. The script can be saved and used later to re-execute the saved commands

To open a new script file 
  + `file` -&gt; (click) `New file` -&gt; `script`
  
*HINT* - make sure to `save as` and save in your correct folder.

However, we already have our script created that you copied frm Github.

Now let's talk a little bit about some r programming basics: packages, functions, and arguments. 

**Packages** are bundles of functions, and if that is meaningless to you it's probably also helpful to know that functions do things. So packages are bundles of things that do things. And like we just talked about, packages must be first be installed into Rstudio using the install packages function and then loaded into the library using the library function. 

**Functions** are things that do things and so one example would be the function mean which finds the mean of a series of numbers or a vector of numbers. A function always includes the parentheses and whatever is inside the parentheses indicates the thing to which the function is being done. And that thing to which the function is being done is called an argument. 

**Arguments** go inside the parentheses and they are separated by commas. You can have more than one argument within the parentheses. Arguments provide extra details regarding how a function should run or what materials a function should work with. And I've included a couple of examples here.

Operators, Objects, and Functions Oh My! 



---
# R Syntax

Similar to all languages, R syntax is composed of "parts of speech" that can be combined into sentences that express complex ideas: 


- *Functions* are the verbs
	- **mean**()
- *Objects* are the nouns of the R language
	+ mean(**student_grades**)
- *Arguments* are the adverbs or the direct object
	+ mean(student_grades, **na.rm = FALSE**)
-	As in any sentence, there is also “punctuation” or *operators*
  + average_grade **&lt;-** mean(student_grades, na.rm = FALSE)

???

Functions: are everything you do in R. 

Say you want to take the mean of a number, you would write mean( )
Suppose you want to round a number, you would use round( ) and put the number inside the parentheses. Make sure to look in the console pane to see the answer.
- Functions always include parenthesis



Objects: are everything you have in R - things that you save like data frames in tabular form. Think back when you have used excel and you had to save your spread sheet and name it. That is comparable to an object. 

To save something into an object we need to use the assignment operator &lt;-.  The assignment operator is used for assignment operation. Operator that assigns a certain value to a variable and scope is within the function and outside as well. 


We will save the number 20 to the word twenty. I could have easily called the new object any other name to save as the object. Then I can **call** the number by typing twenty in and running it.

Don’t ever want to use TRUE/FALSE, those are reserved for testing logical variables.
Also, NaN, inf and NA are reserved for outcomes such as whether a variable is negative or positive infinity, not a number, or missing.



You only install the package once, ever...mostly ever :). But, you will need to read in the package to Rstudio for each session. Sometimes during the session.

There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics, and machine learning. If you need r to do something then there's probably a package for that.


- We talked about the help window or pane earlier. You can add a question mark before the round() function to look at the arguments. 

- Look for an argument that you can add to pi to round to the nearest 1 decimal places
HINT look under USAGE in the arguments help section

So in this example, “digits = 1” is an argument that provides extra information for how the round function should work. So this little bit of code is saying find the mean of a numeric vector or or a string of numbers. Round that mean to one digit. In the second example, this argument “package_name”, which by the way is a terrible name for a package, is telling R which package to load into its library.

R is a calculator!
  
Type this in your console:  

```r
2 + 3
```

# Logic
.pull-left[
R is logical! 
  
What happens when you run this?  

```r
5 &gt; 3
```
  
Or this?

```r
5 == 3
```

Why not just a single `=` operator?

# Pipes


```r
sci_data &lt;- read_csv("data/sci-online-classes.csv") |&gt; # read in data
  select(student_id, FinalGradeCEMS, course_id, ) |&gt; # select variables
  rename(final_grade = FinalGradeCEMS) |&gt; # rename FinalGradeCEMS
  filter(final_grade &gt; .5) |&gt; # keep grades higher than 50% 
  drop_na() # remove rows with missing data
```

Pipes are a very powerful tool for combining a sequence of functions or processes. The original pipe operator `%&gt;%` comes from the {magrittr} but pipe has become such a useful and much used operator in R that it is now baked into R with the new `|&gt;` operator.

# Functions &amp; Arguments - Basic Template

Functions are pre-packaged pieces of code that (typically) start with a verb, followed by objects or inputs in parentheses called "arguments":


```r
do_this(to_this)  
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

---
# Functions &amp; Arguments - Make One

Let's make a basic addition function called `add_numbers`: 


```r
add_numbers &lt;- function(number_1, number_2) {
    number_1 + number_2
}
```

---
# Functions &amp; Arguments - Your Turn

Use your new function to add 5 and 10:

```r
# YOUR CODE HERE
# 
#
```


---
# Functions &amp; Arguments - Solution



```r
add_numbers(5, 10)
```

```
## [1] 15
```

# Functions &amp; Arguments - Real World

.pull-left[
In practice, most functions that we will be using this week take a data frame object as their first argument:

```r
ggplot(sci_data, aes(x = FinalGradeCEMS)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "blue")
```
