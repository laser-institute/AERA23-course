EXPLORE PHASE
This is essentially exploratory data analysis and this phase allows us to gain an understanding of the data such that we can figure out the course of actions and areas that we can to explore in the modeling phase. This entails the use of descriptive statistics and data visualizations. It is in an unstructured way to uncover initial patterns, characteristics, and points of interest. Data exploration is the art of looking at your data, rapidly generating hypotheses, quickly testing them, then repeating again and again and again. The goal of data exploration is to generate many promising leads that you can later explore in more depth

VISUALIZATION
One goal in this phase is explore questions that drive the original analysis
and develop new questions and hypotheses to test in later stages. ggplot2, one of the core members of the tidyverse consists of a grammar of graphics to organize and make sense of  different elements (Wilkinson, 2005). 

TRANSFORMATION
DATA PREPROCESSING in the wrngling phase is usually about getting large volumes of data from the sources — databases, object stores, data lakes, etc — and performing basic data cleaning and data wrangling preparing them for the later part. TO explore the data here you may need to wrangle or preprocess the data further to get descriptive data

FEATURE ENGINEERING is known as the process of transforming raw data (that has already been processed) into features that better represent the underlying problem to predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.
