## Digital Learning Environments

Digital learning environments include any set of technology-based
methods that can be applied to support learning and instruction
(Ifenthaler,2017).

## Sensor and Multimodel

-   Sensors and recording devices (e.g., location, physical movement,
    etc.)

-   Multimodel (e.g., facial expressions, speech recognition, etc.)

::: notes
Sensor data and multimodal data are two types of data used in learning
analytics to gather information about students' learning processes.

Sensor data refers to data collected by various types of sensors, such
as eye-tracking devices, wearable technology, and environmental sensors.
This data can provide information about students' physical activities
and behaviors, such as their posture, movement, and gaze patterns. For
example, eye-tracking data can be used to analyze how students read and
comprehend text, while motion sensor data can be used to track physical
activity and engagement levels.

Multimodal data, on the other hand, refers to data collected from
multiple sources, such as audio, video, text, and images. This type of
data can provide a more comprehensive view of students' learning
experiences, as it captures a range of modalities and perspectives. For
example, multimodal data can be used to analyze how students collaborate
and communicate in group work, as it captures both verbal and nonverbal
cues.
